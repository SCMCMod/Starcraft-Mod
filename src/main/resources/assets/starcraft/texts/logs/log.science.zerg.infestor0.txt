#name: Infestor: Overview
Infestors are one of the more insidious new additions to the Swarm. They were evolved from the Borbu Matriarch, an unusual creature that is more like an ambulatory nest than a single organism. Unlike most Zerg warriors, Infestors have the ability to move while burrowed. These terrors can spew a volatile plague over their targets with dire effects, and they have been known to ingest Infested Marines, carry them to a combat zone, and regurgitate them to fight for the Swarm. Perhaps the Infestor’s most dangerous feature is the Neural Parasite, a symbiotic creature living within Infestors that, when spat, attaches to an enemy and controls its mind for a short period of time. Seeing the immense potential of this parasite, the Queen of Blades is busy incubating new strains that can live longer outside of their host.
